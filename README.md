### Hey there! 👋 I'm Raj

I'm a CS undergrad who loves solving real-world problems with **machine learning**, **cloud tools**, and a growing interest in **fintech** 🧠☁️📊

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: AI-powered platforms, smarter ML models, and some fun backend automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: LangChain, graph databases (Neo4j), AI in finance and better model optimization techniques
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: anything AI, cloud-based apps, or finance-focused projects!
- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Churn prediction with behavioral features (RFM, etc.)
  - Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA (did that for HTML/CSS codegen)
  - YOLOv8, Grad-CAM, and explainable ML
  - Building full-stack AI tools using FastAPI, Firebase, OpenAI, and more
- 📫 How to reach me: jobsraj1510@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love debugging more than the actual coding sometimes 😄

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:
- 🧠 **CodeGen** – AI that writes HTML/CSS using fine-tuned Gemma and soft prompting  
- 📚 **EvalveAI** – AI-powered smart classroom with OpenAI + FAISS + GROQ  
- 🌊 **Marine Debris Detection** – 93.6% mAP with YOLOv8 and real-time Grad-CAM  
- 📈 **Churn Prediction** – Built a model from 250K logs using Naive Bayes & SVM (83% acc.)

When I’m not building or learning, I’m probably solving DSA problems (500+ so far!) or dreaming up the next project 🚀

Thanks for stopping by 👋
